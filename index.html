        </h2>
        <p>
            Sustainable living is a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual's or society's use of the Earth's
            natural resources and personal resources. Practitioners of sustainable living often attempt to reduce their
            carbon footprint by altering methods of transportation, energy consumption, and diet. Proponents of
            sustainable living aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, in natural
            balance and respectful of humanity's symbiotic relationship with the Earth's natural ecology and cycles. The
            practice and general philosophy of sustainable living is highly interrelated with the overall principles of
            sustainable development.

            The term sustainable living is predominantly used and defined in the context of environmentalism, and is
            broadly used to describe a lifestyle that is in balance with the natural environment and fostering a greater
            sense of environmental responsibility. Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability
            to lifestyle choice and decisions.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Sustainable living and zero waste are two different concepts that are often confused. Sustainable living is
            a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual's or society's use of the Earth's natural resources and
            personal resources. Practitioners of sustainable living often attempt to reduce their carbon footprint by
            altering methods of transportation, energy consumption, and diet. Proponents of sustainable living aim to
            conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, in natural balance and respectful of
            humanity's symbiotic relationship with the Earth's natural ecology and cycles. The practice and general
            philosophy of sustainable living is highly interrelated with the overall principles of sustainable
            development.

            Zero waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life
            cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators, or
            the ocean. The process recommended is one similar to the way that resources are reused in nature. The
            definition adopted by the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) is:
